    "# Orchestrator-Workers Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore the orchestrator-workers pattern — a powerful workflow design for creating flexible AI systems that can tackle complex, unpredictable tasks.\n",
    "Using Kotlin and Claude via LangChain4j,\n",
    "we'll implement a practical example that demonstrates\n",
    "how a main _\"orchestrator\"_ LLM can coordinate multiple _\"worker\"_ LLMs to achieve better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the orchestrator-workers pattern?\n",
    "\n",
    "The orchestrator-workers pattern involves using a central LLM (the orchestrator) to analyze a complex task,\n",
    "break it down dynamically into subtasks, and then delegate these subtasks to specialized worker LLMs.\n",
    "Finally, the orchestrator synthesizes the results into a cohesive output.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Orchestrator-Workers Workflow Diagram](image/orchestrator_workers.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow differs from simple parallelization because:\n",
    "- The subtasks aren't predetermined but are identified dynamically by the orchestrator\n",
    "- The orchestrator can make decisions about task allocation based on the specific input\n",
    "- There's an explicit coordination layer that manages the overall process\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use this pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "- Software development tasks that involve changes across multiple files\n",
    "- Complex research or analysis requiring multiple perspectives\n",
    "- Content creation with varying style requirements\n",
    "- Multistep problem-solving with interdependent components\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up environment\n",

    "## How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The orchestrator LLM receives the initial task and analyzes it to identify distinct approaches (like formal and conversational styles)\n",
    "2. Based on its analysis, the orchestrator dynamically generates subtasks with specific requirements\n",
    "3. Each subtask is delegated to a worker LLM, which executes it with the focused parameters\n",
    "4. The orchestrator collects the results from all workers\n",

    "\n",
    "The orchestrator-workers pattern offers a powerful approach to building AI systems that can tackle complex, unpredictable tasks.\n",
    "By dynamically breaking down problems and delegating subtasks to specialized workers,\n",
    "we can create more flexible, adaptable solutions.\n",
