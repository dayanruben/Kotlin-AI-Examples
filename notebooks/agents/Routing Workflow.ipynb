    "# Routing Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore the routing workflow pattern for building AI agents.\n",
    "Using Kotlin and OpenAI's GPT models via the LangChain4j library,\n",
    "we'll implement a practical example that demonstrates how to intelligently route different types of requests to specialized handlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is routing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Routing is a workflow pattern that first classifies an input and then directs it to the most appropriate specialized handler.\n",
    "Think of it as a smart dispatcher that ensures each request is handled by the right expert.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Routing Workflow Diagram](image/routing.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each handler can be optimized for specific input types\n",
    "- Routing logic is isolated from processing logic\n",
    "- Specialized handlers perform better on their specific tasks\n",
    "- Adding new handlers is straightforward\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use routing\n",
    "\n",
    "Common use cases include:\n",
    "- Customer support ticket classification\n",
    "- Content moderation with different policies\n",
    "- Optimizing cost/performance by routing between different model sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up environment\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Create a Strong Password:**\n",

      "\n",
      "**Security Tips:**\n",
      "- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your account if you haven't already. This adds an extra layer of security.\n",

      "5. **Initiate the Export**: Click on the \"Export\" button. Depending on the size of your project data, this may take a moment. Once completed, the file will either download automatically or prompt you to save it.\n",

      "\n",
      "- **Filter Data Before Exporting**: If you only need specific information, consider applying filters to your project data before exporting. This will help you create a more focused and manageable Excel file.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Regular Backups**: Make it a habit to export your project data regularly. This ensures you have up-to-date backups and can track changes over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Related Features:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Data Visualization**: Consider using built-in reporting tools to visualize your project data before exporting. This can provide insights that may be useful for your analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Integration with Other Tools**: If you frequently work with Excel, check if there are integrations available that can automate data syncing between your project management tool and Excel.\n",

    "## How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "Our implementation follows these steps:\n",
    "- Classification\n",
    "- Structured output\n",
    "- Specialized handling\n",
    "- Response generation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The routing workflow offers a powerful approach to handling diverse inputs effectively.\n",
    "By separating classification from specialized handling, we can build systems that are both flexible and highly optimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is particularly valuable for applications dealing with a wide variety of user requests or content types,\n",
    "allowing each specialized component to focus on what it does best while maintaining a coherent overall experience."
