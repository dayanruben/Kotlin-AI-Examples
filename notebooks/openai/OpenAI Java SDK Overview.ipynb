       "Coroutines are a feature in Kotlin that allow for asynchronous programming in a more manageable and readable way compared to traditional callback-based approaches. They help in writing non-blocking code that can easily handle concurrency, making it a popular choice for applications that require tasks like network requests, I/O operations, or any long-running computations without blocking the main thread.\n",
       "\n",
       "Kotlin coroutines are built on the concept of suspending functions, which are marked with the `suspend` keyword. These functions can be paused and resumed, allowing for cooperative multitasking within a single thread, which makes it easier to manage operations that take time to complete.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Key Concepts:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Scope**: Coroutines need to run in a coroutine scope (`CoroutineScope`), which defines the lifecycle of the coroutines launched within it.\n",
       "2. **Dispatchers**: Coroutines can run on different threads using dispatchers (e.g., `Dispatchers.Main`, `Dispatchers.IO`, `Dispatchers.Default`).\n",
       "3. **Launch and Async**: You can use `launch` to start a coroutine that does not return a result, or `async` to start a coroutine that returns a deferred result.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Example:\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's a simple example demonstrating how to use coroutines in Kotlin.\n",
       "\n",
       "```kotlin\n",
       "import kotlinx.coroutines.*\n",
       "\n",
       "fun main() = runBlocking { // This creates a coroutine scope\n",
       "    println(\"Start main\")\n",
       "\n",
       "    // Launch a coroutine in the background\n",
       "    launch {\n",
       "        delay(1000L) // Non-blocking delay for 1 second (1000 milliseconds)\n",
       "        println(\"Coroutine in launch\")\n",
       "    }\n",
       "\n",
       "    // This line will be executed immediately while the coroutine is running\n",
       "    println(\"Main function is running\")\n",
       "\n",
       "    // Use async to get a result back from the coroutine\n",
       "    val deferredResult = async {\n",
       "        performLongTask()\n",
       "    }\n",
       "\n",
       "    // Wait for the result and print it\n",
       "    println(\"Result from long task: ${deferredResult.await()}\") // Await the result\n",
       "    println(\"End main\")\n",
       "}\n",
       "\n",
       "suspend fun performLongTask(): String {\n",
       "    delay(2000L) // Simulating a long operation\n",
       "    return \"Long task completed!\"\n",
       "}\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "### Explanation:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. `runBlocking { ... }`: This is the main coroutine builder that blocks the main thread until all coroutines inside it complete their execution.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. `launch { ... }`: This starts a new coroutine that will run concurrently with the other code. Inside the coroutine, `delay(1000L)` is a suspending function that non-blockingly waits for 1 second.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. `async { ... }`: This starts another coroutine that will compute a result. Inside, it calls the suspending function `performLongTask()`, which simulates a long-running task by using `delay(2000L)`.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. `deferredResult.await()`: This suspends the main coroutine until the result of the `async` operation is ready.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Output:\n",
       "When you run the code, you will see:\n",
       "```\n",
       "Start main\n",
       "Main function is running\n",
       "Coroutine in launch\n",
       "Result from long task: Long task completed!\n",
       "End main\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "This demonstrates the non-blocking behavior and the structured concurrency provided by Kotlin coroutines."
